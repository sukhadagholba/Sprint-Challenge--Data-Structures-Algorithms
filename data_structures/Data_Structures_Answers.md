Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
O(n) since we have to traverse through each node and as the nodes increse the number of operations also increase.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
Space complecity for depth_first_search is O(|V|) where V is the number of nodes.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n) since we have to traverse through each node and as the nodes increase the number of operations also increase.

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
Space complecity for breadth_first_search is O(|V|) where V is the number of nodes.

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
O(n) to craete the Heap with the given array. The _sift_down() method costs O(log n) and is called n times. Hence heapsort costs O(n log n).

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
O(2)
